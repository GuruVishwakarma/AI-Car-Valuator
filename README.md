🚗 AI Car Valuator
📌 Project Overview
AI Car Valuator is a machine learning-based web application that predicts the resale value of a car based on various input parameters such as company, model, year of purchase, fuel type, and kilometers driven. The model is trained to provide an estimated price using historical car price data.

🏗 Tech Stack
Frontend: Streamlit (for UI)
Backend: Python (Flask for API)
Machine Learning: Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy
Deployment: Streamlit, GitHub


🚀 Features
✔️ User-friendly UI to enter car details
✔️ Predicts car resale price based on trained ML model
✔️ Supports multiple car brands, fuel types, and year models
✔️ Real-time prediction output
